121044,guilt,When I shouted and quarrelled and for no reason I had been rude to my  mother and when my behaviour had been influenced by other outward  factors.
121045,joy,"When you are satisfied with something, when you achieve something  you have striven to."
121045,fear,"One fears many things, for example one fears going to the  dentist. but as far as I am concerned this feeling is connected  with the examination session."
121045,anger,When you are unjustly assessed at something you are sure to have  been right.
121045,sadness,"For the loss of a close friend or relative, but you feel grief  when you are away from home, too."

122012,joy,I'm glad when I have good relations with my colleagues and most  of all when we are at a party.
122012,fear,I experienced it once when we were on a drive. Our car passed by  the one comming from the opposite direction at an incredibly  small distance.
122012,anger,"I get angry with people who attain certain status without  deserving it, only with the support, authority and influence of  other people."
122012,sadness,I feel sad when I see things done against men and nothing could  stop it - at least I think so.
122012,disgust,I have experienced disgust with some people - usually double  dealers.
122012,shame,I am ashamed when I am not prepared in a subject and I have to  answer in the presence of the patients.

122015,disgust,"I stayed for several weeks with a friend of mine before she moved  to live with her husband. One evening he came drunk and made an  awful scene, which I still remember."
122015,shame,"In the past I experienced this feeling almost all the time -  wherever I went, in different sutuations. I was small and I had  to be taken to kindergarten, but me the fool didn't dare to tell  exactly where, finally as a result I was late."
122015,guilt,"My roommate got married and invited me to share a flat with them.  But with a young couple there should not be a third person. I am  to blame for not following the advise of the others, but it is  not late still."
122016,joy,"I experienced this feeling when I was accepted as a student.  Because everything turned out different from my expectations.  Although I passed the exam successfully I was accepted as a  student only when I didn't expect it at all, namely at the  beginning of September."
122016,fear,In the real sense of the word I experienced fear in my first  months in the army. During my first night of duty. The cause for  all this was a bear. I became panic sticken (may be for the first  time) and even forgot that I had a gun.
122016,anger,When I was a soldier I quarrelled with my commander and may be in  revenge for this he detailed me on duty two successive nights.  Naturally he checked me up on the second night and found me  asleep for which he sent me to the cells.
122016,sadness,Sometimes I experience sadness for the Sports High School and for  my unrealized dreams in the sport. Anyway there I spent six years  of my life.
161020,disgust,"Sort of awkward. I'd introduced (a lover) but introduced as a  friend to some members of my family, and my niece Yavanna who's  six was home from school and at Mum's and Dad's and was really  silly and at first it was ok, but it went on and on - yukky pooh!  You eat your snot, etc. and I felt cross she wouldn't stop. But  she had an audience and was in one of those moods. Once I'd  accepted it was something everyone does at time I felt better -  it was partly having my friend there."
161020,shame,"In my 20s - and was going out to dinner to celebrate a friend's  birthday. Her (older - in 30s) cousin, really wanted me to get  drunk cos I'd visited their (cousin & wife) place quite a bit,  but had always been very careful - brought up to believe in  moderation in drink (but not guilt repression etc). I mixed  drinking with smoking (which I rarely did) and got drunk and had  to leave the table to get sick in the loo, and later went home  and was sick again; have never felt so awful in my life. And I  didn't want to face or tell my other flatmates, or family."
161020,guilt,I used to pinch change from my father's mantlepiece (never my  mother - she didn't get enough housekeeping) and then I'd feel  when we went to church as a family I'd felt awkward cos I felt  I'm expected to go to communion and I would but I was afraid and  guilty 'cos I committed a mortal sin.

161021,fear,Can think of no time that I have felt fear.

161023,guilt,I had to leave an important function early because of family  commitments. Someone else had to complete my job.
161024,joy,I was seriously injured in a road accident. The very first steps  I took with only one crutch to support me I felt so good. I enjoy  being alive.
161024,fear,"I was attacked, standing in a doorway, by a pack of 5 dogs,  alsatians and farm dogs with my escape route blocked by a shut  fence."
161024,anger,"In the house where I live there is a new flatmate. His friends  unfortunately are the dirt of society, intelligent, fashonable,  rich and bored. At a party recently they were doing things I  didn't like done in my house. I felt angry at them."
161024,sadness,I was driving near my girlfriend's house and I decided to keep  going because it was late and I would be back in the next few  days anyway. The next day she was killed in a road accident.
161024,disgust,My girlfriend came home after a business dinner at the most  expensive place in town drunk as a skunk. Whats more she drove  home and couldn't remember doing so. I was disgusted by her state  and her actions.
161024,shame,A good friend of mine told me in comfidence that once he had  tried to commit suicide. To meet him you wouldn't think so. I  told another friend of mine about this when she was feeling  depressed about her twin brother's suicide. I broke a bond of  confidentiality.
161024,guilt,"When I was young I stole something from a shop and got caught,  then I was taken to the police station and my parents had to come  and get me."

161025,fear,When confronted and in my opinion hassled by the police.
121045,disgust,"Disgust - no. Maybe it is more precise to say revultion at a worm  or a snake. But I mean it in a social aspect when somebody had  behaved like a scoundrel to you, when by his actions he has made  you change your attitude towards him but I thing this feeling the  way I meant it, is not typical for the people interrelations."
121045,shame,When you betray the trust you have been given. This is connected  with copying at a class-work at school.
121045,guilt,"When I have forgotten to warn somebody for something, or when I  have forgotten to bring something I have been asked for."
121046,joy,"When, for example, I was in my eleventh school year and I learned  I had been classed for the Bulgarian Language and Literature  National Olympiad."

121047,fear,The last time I felt it was when I was coming home late at night.
121047,anger,I haven't often felt this feeling. Once someone stole my garment.
121047,sadness,Recently I happened to remain alone for a long time.
121047,disgust,I don't remember about a situation when I have experienced this  feeling. Maybe it was when I saw a drunkard in the street.
121047,shame,I lied to my best friend and I wouldn't reform what I had done.
121047,guilt,It happens to me quite often. I can't describe a particular case.
121048,joy,"Realizing one's desire, an experienced feeling of satisfaction  from the realization of one's desires and aims."

121050,anger,Unjust punishment of a friend of mine.
121050,sadness,After the loss of a close relative.
121050,disgust,When somebody behaves like a scoundrel. Recently a colleague of  mine used the name of another one for his own benefit.

121052,joy,Meeting a loved man.
121052,fear,"I felt a physical fear, if I can call it this way, today, in the bus where  I was sitting on the first seat. While turning the driver didn't  see the tram which was making a dash towards us (coming from the  side I was), and whose driver intended to cross in yellow  light."

121052,guilt,When something unpleasant happens to a friend or relative of  yours and you are at the bottom of it.
121053,joy,"I sensed such a feeling when I understood I was admitted to the  University. I was at home, the atmosphere was still, though I  myself was full of suspense. I tried to do different things. When  the telephone rang and...! Yes, of course there were other  situations when I felt a similar feeling but I was unmindful of  them."
121053,fear,This feeling I sensed quite recently. It was arisen by the  terrific thought that I might lose the man I loved !
121053,anger,"Anger I felt when my boyfriend told me he didn't mind breaking it  off with me, i.e. each of us to take his own road. Because until  that moment, he deliberately restricted our dates. The motives  were brought to my knowledge later."
121053,sadness,"Sometimes, when I'm alone I am seized by this feeling. But it  always helps me to come round and at the same time to judge if it  is worth. Very often this feeling is caused to me by people -  friends who I love and respect."
121053,disgust,Such a feeling springs up in me sometimes when I have meals at a  catering establishment. It is a result either of the look of the  food or when watching the way some people eat.
121053,shame,This happens to me when I am not prepared in a given subject.
121053,guilt,"Quite unconsciously I offended a girlfriend of mine. It was  really worthy to pass this fact over in silence, but I acted so,  because I believed I was right. In fact it often happens to me to  feel guilt, after I have already done the deed."
121054,joy,When I was admitted to the University.
121054,fear,"I had to have my tonsils out. I had been making up my mind almost  for a year - I was afraid. But during the two hours in the  hospital room, while I was waiting to be called for the operation I  felt a real fear - of the pain, of what they were going to do to  me, of the unknown."
121054,anger,In a conversation my boyfriend expressed definite and quite  pretentious opinions and he took up an attitude towards a theory  which he himself had never known. His information was from  fortuitous sources.
121054,sadness,"Summer, heavy rain, storm - I was standing with my face stick to  the window: the childhood, something was going away forever this  summer, I was leaving my home, I was going to study in another  town, for the first time I was leaving my parents, friends, I had  to manage myself, a long and loved period of my life was over - I  was crying."
121054,disgust,I saw in the street a man spitting.
121054,shame,"I talked with a man who stammered and without controlling myself,  I started to talk imitating him."
121054,guilt,"Always, and this happens often when I do not keep my word."

121055,guilt,When I offend somebody unfairly.
121056,joy,A quarrel was followed by the decision of leaving a person close  to me. Several days later my regret was great. I was beside  myself. Quite unexpectedly he came and the conflict was calmly  solved. I was glad at the possibility to be with him.
121056,fear,"One evening I was watching the news on TV. Again they were  talking about the danger of war. Suddenly I imagined what it  might mean for me, for my friends, for the people close to me. I  felt it a very near and possible event."
121056,anger,"Unfair and unjust attitude toward a person close to me, what I  was the witness of, caused anger in me."
121056,sadness,"The thought that I'll never sit at the school desk again, caused  a deep grief at the end of my eleventh form."
121056,disgust,I felt disgust with a person whose behaviour was out of the  elementary human norms.
121056,shame,I had not punched a ticket in the bus because I had a card. But  when the ticket-collector came it turned out that I had forgotten  it. The shame I felt was great though it was not done on purpose.
121056,guilt,At a moment of affect I offended a person very close to me. He  had given me ground for that but it was a trifling in comparison  with the way I insulted him. A moment later I felt a sense of  guilt.
121057,joy,When I understood I was admitted to the Sofia University.
121057,anger,"The doctors from Belogradchik town determined a wrong diagnosis  to my son. A month later, after some complex examinations at ISUL  (A medical institute in Sofia), the diagnosis was categorically rejected."
121057,sadness,"My son lives with my parents in the country and I feel this  feeling always when leaving for Sofia, but the last time it was  quite strong."
121057,disgust,A colleague of mine asked a lecturer to put him a higher mark in  order to keep his good mards and thus to continue getting a  scholarship for an excellent grade.

121072,fear,Before an exam in logics.
121072,anger,My husband and I were invited at the house of our nieghbours then  we got an invitation on the part of my parents which we had to  refuse. A a result they called me by words that provoked my  anger.
121072,sadness,My son lives in the country. I feel sadness when I see mothers  having walks with their children.
121072,disgust,"The behaviour of a colleague of mine, which doesn't correspond to  my norms of behaviour."
121072,shame,I was to take part in a cocktail party on the occasion of our  national holiday as a servant.
121072,guilt,I ignored and offended my parents on the eve of the New Year.
121073,joy,"The sense of joy comes to me always after a period of depression,  as an organic feeling for an upsurge. I don't exclude the  situative feeling but in this case the reason is not in me, it's  out of me."
121073,fear,I bet that I would jump down from a window. I was sure that I  would jump but before I did it I rather felt fear.
121073,disgust,A lie on the part of a person close to me.
121073,shame,I thought I had taken a decision but I hesitated.

121074,joy,My son was born.
121074,fear,I had a car accident.

121074,guilt,I didn't give back in time some money that I had borrowed. My  friend relied on them.
122001,joy,After 10 days of hard work and having suffered many changes I  passed my last exam.
122001,fear,Before going to the dentist.
122001,anger,When I am made to do things in which I see no sense and I waste  my time. Some time ago I had to participate in a sociological  investigation and then I got really angry.
122001,sadness,"When I feel I must be with somebody, to talk with somebody - but  I am alone."
122001,shame,"I am ashamed when I am not ready for my seminar in internal  diseases, simply because the assistant professor is a person who  deserves high respect."

122004,guilt,I felt guilty when once I made my mother angry.
122005,joy,Six months ago when I got acquaintanced with a person whom I  trusted infinitely and from whom I expected help and friendly  feelings. With him I found much in common - in our views and in  our fate.
122005,fear,Few days ago I really experienced fear. It was connected with  unexpected actions on the part of a group of people. This evoked  in me many negative emotions.
122005,anger,"I always get angry when somebody deceives me, or tries to conceal  his lie skilfully and this offends me even more."
122005,sadness,Sadness - this is an emotion which I have felt very often  recently. I can't remember a concrete example. I will describe my  general impression from severl situations which evoked this  feeling in me.
122005,disgust,"I became disgusted with the man on whom I had counted, who I had  trusted, the man who should have been my mainstay - my father.  I could hardly make myself (and the others) believe in this  emotion. It has cumulated after events and deeds. Everything can  happen in this world."
122005,shame,"I am ashamed of the way my father behaves with my mother and  sister, and with me too."
122005,guilt,"I didn't keep a promise I had made to a man, and in this way I  lost his esteem and confidence in me. I caused him a lot of  trouble."

122007,sadness,"Sadness, no, I felt something much stronger when my father died."

122016,guilt,I felt guilty last year during the winter term exams. A colleague  of mine asked me to give him my lecture notes (I had very good  notes and I had passed my exam in advance) but I still don't know  why I didn't give them to him.

But I had difficulties in moving my luggage because I  couldn't wait for a car to come. How amazed I was to hear them  threatening me they would throw our my things.

This  was one of few question which crept up vividly every time I  thought about what had happened."
161014,disgust,I'm very disgusted when I see people abusing their body with  drugs and alcohol. They take advantage of these things usually  for an excuse for the fantasies which they like and so they do  things stupidly and unjustly.

Some of them read books while the others  argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two  hours without the main theme being discussed.

Some others were playing bridge and A had nothing to do, besides  it was A who had prepared the food.  Later when we wanted to talk  and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him.   They only asked him a few questions half-heartedly and then they  talked on their own.  Some of their conversation was against me and   another classmate."

I realized that I  had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any  thing about it. "
331049,guilt,I went to a friend's baptism as she became a Christian after me  and I realized that she was more enthusiastic about her spiritual  life than I was.

Before getting into the bus I had prepared the exact amount of  coins to pay for the bus fair and when I got into the bus I put  these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair.  I  thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside.  However the  bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins  were stuck at the opening  of the box.  He had not seen me paying  and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box.  I could not  understand this and the driver kept questioning me.  He made me  feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just  to get away from him.  Later I found that I had forgotten a few  coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first  time.  After I had entered the bus I could still hear him  scolding me and I felt disgusted.
331050,shame,"A few days back I had a tutorial class and the teacher randomly  assigned one person in each group to make a presentation.

The devil did not have any expression on  his face and I thought that he would choose me."
331051,anger,My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that  he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's  house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I  felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so  he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is  I was in a bad mood then).
331051,sadness,I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good  friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them  I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind  this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made  up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was  sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends.
331051,disgust,"I had a friend who was very kind to me.  I tried my best to like  him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help  rejecting, criticizing and blaming him.  I wanted to get away  from him as soon as possible."

A close    friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my  application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had  been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the  list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was  really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all  day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the  good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my  studies.  "
331052,fear,A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes  outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would  question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and  did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet  him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very  unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble.
331052,anger,We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the  inter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there  was nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating  lunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them  and then left.

The quarrel made my father think that his children   may not take care of him in the future (it was a slip of the tongue and   this made me realize that my father keeps his thoughts to himself).  I was   still very angry so I dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen   to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house."
331053,joy,That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the  higher level as fast as possible.

331061,fear,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was  afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very  unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of  passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to  repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results  were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a  minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
